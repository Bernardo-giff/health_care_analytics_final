# Individual assignment - Health care analytics

As the final assignment of "Healthcare analytics" module, we were asked to analyse data from the [AddHealth repository](https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/)

This is a comprehensive study that followed teenagers (wave 1) until their fifties (wave 5). The study was conducted across multiple waves with different approaches each time.

This study was conducted in R, and you can find the results in the pdf file along with the discussion. Note that this is an introductory subject, and the limitations of the analysis from a healthcare perspective are quite clear.

The core of the analysis was conducted in a R markdown file and is available here: [Individual assignment analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/Bernardo-giff/health_care_analytics_final/blob/main/Individual%20assignment%20analysis.Rmd)

Our focus was applying regression techniches to the different variables to test prior assumptions about some of the health care metrics.
